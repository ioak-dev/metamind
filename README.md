# Zettelkasten-inspired Note-Taking Platform

Our web application is a dynamic note-taking system designed to foster idea connections through clusters. It harnesses artificial intelligence to intuitively link related notes, transforming information into a coherent network of interconnected ideas.

## Key Features

AI-driven Linking: Seamlessly connects related notes, leveraging advanced AI algorithms for effortless idea association.

Network Visualization: Offers a visually captivating experience by representing notes as nodes in a network graph, enabling users to grasp intricate relationships effortlessly.

Custom Metadata: Flexibility to incorporate custom metadata attributes, allowing users to personalize their organizational structure.

Robust Search: Empowers users with a powerful search function to swiftly navigate through their notes and clusters.

## Objective

The primary goal of this application is to serve as a personalized 'second brain,' visually mapping and organizing users' ideas in a spatial coordinate system. By sidestepping the limitations of the brain's temporal representation, our platform constructs a spatial representation based on idea relatedness. This fosters a more intuitive and interconnected approach to idea management.

## Vision

Our platform aims to revolutionize the way individuals manage and interact with their ideas, providing a digital landscape that mirrors the complexity and connectivity of the human thought process.
